Open Pipe Kit Speck CLI
==================

Uses node-hid, which requires libusb and libusb-dev: `sudo apt-get install libusb-1.0.0 libusb-1.0-0-dev libusb-dev`

Must be run with sudo!

Also, currently (June 5 2015) we are only taking spot readings every <interval>, not averaging. We should change or specify.
